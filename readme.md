This JSFL file is a Flash Professional extension that generates classes and interfaces for your Flash Professional library symbols. You can place the JSFL file in the commands folder in your Flash installation. The downloads button has an MXP file so you can also install the JSFL file using the MXP installer and it will place it in the correct location for you using the Extension Manager.

A video of what the extension does can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTiMfF6UefQ
